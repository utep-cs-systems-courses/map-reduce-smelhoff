## Info

This repository is for assignment 2: Map-Reduce.  
The file 'mapReduce.py' searches for a set of words within the works of Shakespeare.  
There are two different ways the searching is implemented both in serial and parallel.  
    1. Iterate through the list of words, checking a master list containing all words in the document.
    2. Iterate through each document, checking for each word.
